Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world -- and that is reflected in its healthcare system. According to the government's Covid-19 response plan from last May, the country only has 1,595 intensive care beds and 480 ventilators for its about 30 million people. It also has a shortage of doctors, with just 0.7 physicians per 100,000 people, according to World Bank data -- less than India's 0.9. Health workers on long-term leave are being called back to help manage the crisis, while the Nepal Army directed retired medical staff Wednesday to stand ready to be recalled. As of Saturday, there were hospital bed shortages in 22 of the country's 77 districts, according to Nepal's Health Emergency Operation Center (HEOC). Dr. Paras Shrestha, a senior physician at a Covid-19 ICU ward in the border city of Nepalgunj, says his hospital is so overrun he's advising patients with mild symptoms to isolate at home.
